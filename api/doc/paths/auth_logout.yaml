        Since the access token has a very short life span, we made the choice to not
        store it in the database or the API. Thus, it can't be revoked. The client
        has the responsability to delete it on manual logout. The token should also
        be deleted when the browser window is closed, or when the user navigates to
        another website.

        details in the security section.*
